# CEN4020-Software-Engineering-Group-3-Project

To develop a user-friendly, computing software system that streamlines the process of employee expense reporting, ensuring accurate and timely submission, review, and approval of business-related expenses.
Desired Key Features of EERIS:

Automated Expense Capture: The new software system is expected to be able to scan a receipt or its uploaded image to seamlessly "scrape" or extract its data mentioned above to automatically populate expense details in the system's database or files. 

Intuitive Interface: If needed, the above feature can be disabled. In this case, the system provides a user-friendly dashboard or command line interface for employees to easily input expense data from a receipt.
Receipt Uploading: Employees can use the system to upload a snap photo or scanned image of a receipt into the system for verification.

Expense Category Management: The system has a comprehensive list of pre-defined expense categories (e.g., travel, meals, office supplies, entertainment, training, transportation, etc.) with customizable subcategories (e.g., parking, auto repairing, gas are a subcategory of transportation) to align with company policy. 

Real-Time Access: The system provides a dashboard or simple set of commands for one or more than one employees and supervisors to input/edit/remove/monitor receipts and their status, review details, and track expense approval process in real-time. 

Reporting and Analytics: The EERIS can generate detailed and summary reports on all or selected expense patterns to aid in financial analysis and decision-making.
